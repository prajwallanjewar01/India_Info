The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism, were composed during this period, and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain. Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west. The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period. On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation. In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period, as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.<\/p>[\/et_pb_toggle][et_pb_toggle title=&#8221;MEDIVAL HISTORY&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; locked=&#8221;off&#8221;]<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity. When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal. When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south. No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region. During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes. The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language. They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent. Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well. Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation. By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Java. Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies<br \/>united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia&#8217;s north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206. The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs. By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north. The sultanate&#8217;s<br \/>raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire. Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India, and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.<\/p>[\/et_pb_toggle][et_pb_toggle title=&#8221;MODERN HISTORY&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; locked=&#8221;off&#8221;]<p>Historians consider India&#8217;s modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes\u2014among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph\u2014were introduced not<br \/>long after their introduction in Europe. However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule. Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a<br \/>gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest. In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.<\/p>\n<p>The rush of technology and the commercialization of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets. There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines, and, despite the risks of<br \/>infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians. There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption. The railway network provided critical famine<br \/>relief, notably reduced the cost of moving goods, and helped nascent Indian-owned industry. After World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served, a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the<br \/>beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol. During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections. The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress&#8217;s final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.<\/p>\n<p>Vital to India&#8217;s self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic. It has remained a democracy with civil liberties, an active Supreme Court, and a largely independent press. Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1990s, has<br \/>created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world&#8217;s fastest-growing economies, and increased its geopolitical clout. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture. Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and<br \/>urban; by religious and caste-related violence; by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies; and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India. It has unresolved territorial disputes with China and with Pakistan. India&#8217;s sustained democratic freedoms are unique among theworld&#8217;s newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.<\/p>[\/et_pb_toggle][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; locked=&#8221;off&#8221;][et_pb_column _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; type=&#8221;4_4&#8243;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>GEOGRAPHY OF INDIA<\/h2>\n<p>India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate. India&#8217;s defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading<br \/>to its south-west, and later, south and southeast. Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate. These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth&#8217;s mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.<\/p>\n<p>Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.

Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter&#8217;s extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe<br \/>floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India&#8217;s southwestern coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.<\/p>[\/et_pb_toggle][et_pb_toggle title=&#8221;PLATEAU &#038; COASTLINE&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; locked=&#8221;off&#8221;]<p>The original Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coalrich Chota Nagpur Plateau\u00a0 in Jharkhand in the east. To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats; the plateau contains the country&#8217;s oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6\u00b0 44\u2032 and 35\u00b0 30\u2032 north latitude[i] and 68\u00b0 7\u2032 and 97\u00b0 25\u2032 east longitude.<\/p>\n<p>India&#8217;s coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains. According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.<\/p>[\/et_pb_toggle][et_pb_toggle title=&#8221;CLIMATE&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; locked=&#8221;off&#8221;]<p>The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[179] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.[180][181] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India&#8217;s rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.<\/p>\n<p>Temperatures in India have risen by 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) between 1901 and 2018.[183] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[184] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.<\/p>[\/et_pb_toggle][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_column _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; type=&#8221;4_4&#8243;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<h2>CULTURE<\/h2>\n<p>Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years. During the Vedic period (c. 1700 BCE \u2013 c. 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dh\u00e1rma, k\u00e1rma, y\u00f3ga, and mok\u1e63a, were established. India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation&#8217;s major religions. The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads, the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement, and by Buddhist philosophy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_toggle title=&#8221;VISUAL ART&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<p>South Asia has an ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged influences with the parts of Eurasia. Seals from the third millennium BCE Indus Valley Civilization of Pakistan and northern India have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The &#8220;Pashupati&#8221; seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928\u201329, is the best known. After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving. Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement. In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and South-East Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art. Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly-flowing forms expressing prana (&#8220;breath&#8221; or life-force). This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.<\/p>[\/et_pb_toggle][et_pb_toggle title=&#8221;SOCIETY&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; locked=&#8221;off&#8221;]<p>Traditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as j\u0101tis, or &#8220;castes&#8221;. India declared untouchability to be illegal in 1947 and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives. Family values are important in the Indian tradition, and multigenerational patriarchal joint families have been the norm in India,<br \/>though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas. An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders. Marriage is thought to be for life,and the divorce rate is extremely low, with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce. Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age. Female infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63 million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period, and constituting 20 percent of India&#8217;s female electorate. According to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care. Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society. The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines. Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws. Many Indian festivals are religious in origin.<\/p>[\/et_pb_toggle][et_pb_toggle title=&#8221;ARCHITECTURE AND LITERATURE&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; locked=&#8221;off&#8221;]<p>Much of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles. Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours. Vastu shastra, literally &#8220;science of construction&#8221; or &#8220;architecture&#8221; and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings; it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs. As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the &#8220;absolute&#8221;. The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as &#8220;the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world&#8217;s heritage&#8221;. Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.<\/p>[\/et_pb_toggle][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi are <\/strong><strong>best known Festivals <\/strong><\/h4>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_column _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; type=&#8221;4_4&#8243;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<h2>CUISINE<\/h2>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Indian cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines. Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially from each other, using locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruit. Indian foodways have been influenced by religion, in particular Hindu cultural choices and traditions. They have been also shaped by Islamic rule, particularly that of the Mughals, by the arrival of the Portuguese on India&#8217;s southwestern shores, and by British rule. These three influences are reflected, respectively, in the dishes of pilaf and biryani; the vindaloo; and the tiffin and the Railway mutton curry. Earlier, the Columbian exchange had brought the potato, the tomato, maize, peanuts, cashew nuts, pineapples, guavas, and most notably, chilli peppers, to India. Each became staples of use. In turn, the spice trade between India and Europe was a catalyst for Europe&#8217;s Age of Discovery.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>The cereals grown in India, their choice, times, and regions of planting, correspond strongly to the timing of India&#8217;s monsoons, and the variation across regions in their associated rainfall. In general, the broad division of cereal zones in India, as determined by their dependence on rain, was firmly in place before the arrival of artificial irrigation. Rice, which requires a lot of water, has been grown traditionally in regions of high rainfall in the northeast and the western coast, wheat in regions of moderate rainfall, like India&#8217;s northern plains, and millet in regions of low rainfall, such as on the Deccan Plateau and in Rajasthan.<\/p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_slider _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; auto=&#8221;on&#8221; auto_speed=&#8221;4000&#8243;][et_pb_slide heading=&#8221;MAHARASHTRA&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; background_enable_color=&#8221;off&#8221; title_text=&#8221;A4V01ChhoWfGHpSxGE05JYGUqbBHS-3-xVZaEcbENn4szVdGRh0reIoPf1Xf8FrXSVgJsTE1YgsU8_zichCfgIdAH_g=w1000&#8243; background_image=&#8221;http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/A4V01ChhoWfGHpSxGE05JYGUqbBHS-3-xVZaEcbENn4szVdGRh0reIoPf1Xf8FrXSVgJsTE1YgsU8_zichCfgIdAH_gw1000.jpeg&#8221; background_enable_image=&#8221;on&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; use_bg_overlay=&#8221;on&#8221;]<p><span>Maharashtrians are known for their\u00a0<\/span><strong>extremely spicy and unique masalas.<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>Chicken and fish<\/strong><span>\u00a0are the common non-veg items you\u2019ll find here.

It is the world&#8217;s sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), on a per capita income basis, India ranked 145th by GDP (nominal) and 122th by GDP (PPP).From independence in 1947 until 1991, successive governments promoted protectionist economic policies with extensive state intervention and economic regulation, which is characterised as dirigism, in the form of the License Raj. The end of the Cold War and an acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 led to the adoption of a broad economic liberalisation in India. Since the start of the 21st century, annual average GDP growth has been 6% to 7%, and from 2013 to 2018, India was the world&#8217;s fastest growing major economy, surpassing China. Historically, India was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until the 19th century.<\/p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row column_structure=&#8221;1_2,1_2&#8243;

Agriculture accounted for 23% of GDP, and employed 59% of the country&#8217;s total workforce in 2016. As the Indian economy has diversified and grown, agriculture&#8217;s contribution to GDP has steadily declined from 1951 to 2011, yet it is still the country&#8217;s largest employment source and a significant piece of its<br \/>overall socio-economic development. Crop-yield-per-unit-area of all crops has grown since 1950, due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year plans and steady improvements in irrigation, technology, application of modern agricultural practices and provision of agricultural credit and subsidies since the Green Revolution in India. However, international comparisons reveal the average yield in India is generally 30% to 50% of the highest average yield in the world. The states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, West Bengal, Gujarat and Maharashtra are key contributors to Indian agriculture.<\/p>\n<p>India receives an average annual rainfall of 1,208 millimeters (47.6 in) and a total annual precipitation of 4000 billion cubic meters, with the total utilizable\u00a0 ater<br \/>resources, including surface and groundwater, amounting to 1123 billion cubic meters. 546,820 square kilometers (211,130 sq. mi) of the land area, or about 39% of the total cultivated area, is irrigated. India&#8217;s inland water resources and marine resources provide employment to nearly six million people in the fisheries sector. In 2010, India had the world&#8217;s sixth-largest fishing industry.<\/p>\n<p>India is the largest producer of milk, jute and pulses, and has the world&#8217;s second-largest cattle population with 170 million animals in 2011. It is the second-largest producer of rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton and groundnuts, as well as the second-largest fruit and vegetable producer, accounting for 10.9% and 8.6% of the world fruit and vegetable production, respectively. India is also the second-largest producer and the largest consumer of silk, producing 77,000 tons in<br \/>2005. India is the largest exporter of cashew kernels and cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL). Foreign exchange earned by the country through the export of cashew kernels during 2011\u201312 reached \u20b943.9 billion (equivalent to \u20b967 billion or US$930 million in 2019) based on statistics from the Cashew Export Promotion Council of India (CEPCI). 131,000 tones of kernels were exported during 2011\u201312. There are about 600 cashew processing units in<br \/>Kollam, Kerala. India&#8217;s food grain production remained stagnant at approximately 252 million tones (MT) during both the 2015\u201316 and 2014\u201315 crop years (July\u2013June). India exports several agriculture products, such as Basmati rice, wheat, cereals, spices, fresh fruits, dry fruits, buffalo beef meat, cotton, tea, coffee and other cash crops particularly to the Middle East, Southeast and East Asian countries. About 10 percent of its export earnings come from this trade.<\/p>[\/et_pb_toggle][et_pb_toggle title=&#8221;MANUFACTURING&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; locked=&#8221;off&#8221;]<p>Industry accounts for 26% of GDP and employs 22% of the total workforce. According to the World Bank, India&#8217;s industrial manufacturing GDP output in 2015 was 6th largest in the world on current US dollar basis ($559 billion),[214] and 9th largest on inflation-adjusted constant 2005 US dollar basis ($197.1 billion).[215] The industrial sector underwent significant changes due to the 1991 economic reforms, which removed import restrictions, brought in foreign<br \/>competition, led to the privatisation of certain government-owned public-sector industries, liberalised the foreign direct investment (FDI) regime,[216] improved infrastructure and led to an expansion in the production of fast-moving consumer goods.[217] Post-liberalisation, the Indian private sector was faced with increasing domestic and foreign competition, including the threat of cheaper Chinese imports. It has since handled the change by squeezing costs, revamping management, and relying on cheap labour and new technology. However, this has also reduced employment generation, even among smaller manufacturers who previously relied on labour-intensive processes.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>DEFENCE<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>With strength of over 1.3 million active personnel, India has the third-largest military force and the largest volunteer army. The total budget sanctioned for the Indian military for the financial year 2019\u201320 was \u20b93.01 trillion (US$42 billion).[219] Defence spending is expected to rise to US$62 billion by 2022.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>ELECTRICITY SECTORY<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Primary energy consumption of India is the third-largest after China and the US with 5.3% global share in the year 2015. Coal and crude oil together account for 85% of the primary energy consumption of India. India&#8217;s oil reserves meet 25% of the country&#8217;s domestic oil demand.[222][223] As of April 2015, India&#8217;s total proven crude oil reserves are 763.476 million metric tons, while gas reserves stood at 1,490 billion cubic metres (53 trillion cubic feet). Oil and natural gas fields are located offshore at Bombay High, Krishna Godavari Basin and the Cauvery Delta, and onshore mainly in the states of Assam, Gujarat and Rajasthan. India is the fourth-largest consumer of oil and net oil imports were nearly \u20b98,200 billion (US$110 billion) in 2014\u201315, which had an adverse effect on the country&#8217;s current account deficit. The petroleum industry in India mostly consists of public sector companies such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL). There are some major private Indian companies in the oil sector such as Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) which operates the world&#8217;s largest oil refining complex.<\/p>\n<p>India became the world&#8217;s third-largest producer of electricity in 2013 with a 4.8% global share in electricity generation, surpassing Japan and Russia. By the end of calendar year 2015, India had an electricity surplus with many power stations idling for want of demand.[227] The utility electricity sector had an installed capacity of 303 GW as of May 2016 of which thermal power contributed 69.8%, hydroelectricity 15.2%, other sources of renewable energy 13.0%, and nuclear power 2.1%.[228] India meets most of its domestic electricity demand through its 106 billion tonnes of proven coal reserves.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>ENGINEERING<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Engineering is the largest sub-sector of India&#8217;s industrial sector, by GDP, and the third-largest by exports.[236] It includes transport\u00a0 equipment, machine tools, capital goods, transformers, switchgear, furnaces, and cast and forged parts for turbines, automobiles, and railways. The industry employs about four million workers. On a value-added basis, India&#8217;s engineering subsector exported $67 billion worth of engineering goods in the 2013\u201314 fiscal year, and served<br \/>part of the domestic demand for engineering goods. The engineering industry of India includes its growing car, motorcycle and scooters industry, and productivity machinery such as tractors. India manufactured and assembled about 18 million passenger and utility vehicles in 2011, of which 2.3 million were exported.[238] India is the largest producer and the largest market for tractors, accounting for 29% of global tractor production in 2013.[238][239] India is the 12th-largest producer and 7th-largest consumer of machine tools. The automotive manufacturing industry contributed $79 billion (4% of GDP) and employed 6.76 million people (2% of the workforce) in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>[\/et_pb_toggle][et_pb_toggle title=&#8221;BANKING AND FINANCE&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; locked=&#8221;off&#8221;]<p>The financial services industry contributed $809 billion (37% of GDP) and employed 14.17 million people (3% of the workforce) in 2016, and the banking sector contributed $407 billion (19% of GDP) and employed 5.5 million people (1% of the workforce) in 2016. The Indian money market is classified into the organized sector, comprising private, public and foreign-owned commercial banks and cooperative banks, together known as &#8216;scheduled banks&#8217;; and the unorganized sector, which includes individual or family-owned indigenous bankers or money lenders and non-banking financial companies.[281] The unorganized<br \/>sector and microcredit are preferred over traditional banks in rural and sub-urban areas, especially for non-productive purposes such as short-term loans for ceremonies. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi nationalised 14 banks in 1969, followed by six others in 1980, and made it mandatory for banks to provide 40% of their net credit to priority sectors including agriculture, small-scale industry, retail trade and small business, to ensure that the banks fulfilled their social and developmental goals. Since then, the number of bank branches has increased from 8,260 in 1969 to 72,170 in 2007 and the population covered by a branch decreased from 63,800 to 15,000 during the same period. The total bank deposits increased from \u20b959.1 billion (equivalent to \u20b92.3 trillion or US$32 billion in 2019) in 1970\u201371 to \u20b938,309 billion (equivalent to \u20b978 trillion or US$1.1 trillion in 2019) in 2008\u201309. Despite an increase of rural branches \u2013 from 1,860 or 22% of the total in 1969 to 30,590 or 42% in 2007 \u2013 only 32,270 of 500,000 villages are served by a scheduled bank.<\/p>[\/et_pb_toggle][et_pb_toggle title=&#8221;TOURISM&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; locked=&#8221;off&#8221;]<p>The World Travel &amp; Tourism Council calculated that tourism generated \u20b915.24 trillion (US$210 billion) or 9.4% of the nation&#8217;s GDP in 2017 and supported 41.622 million jobs, 8% of its total employment. The sector is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 6.9% to \u20b932.05 trillion (US$450 billion) by 2028 (9.9% of GDP). Over 10 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2017 compared to 8.89 million in 2016, recording a growth of 15.6%. India earned $21.07 billion in foreign exchange from tourism receipts in 2015. International tourism to India has seen a steady growth from 2.37 million arrivals in 1997 to 8.03 million arrivals in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is the largest source of international tourists to India, while European Union nations and Japan are other major sources of international tourists. Less than 10% of international tourists visit the Taj Mahal, with the majority visiting other cultural, thematic and holiday circuits. Over 12 million Indian citizens take international trips each year for tourism, while domestic tourism within India adds about 740 million Indian travellers. India has a fast-growing medical tourism sector of its health care economy, offering low-cost health services and long-term care. In October 2015, the medical tourism sector was estimated to be worth US$3 billion. It is projected to grow to $7\u2013 8 billion by 2020.[314] In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients traveled to India to seek medical treatment.<\/p>[\/et_pb_toggle][et_pb_toggle title=&#8221;SECURITY MARKET&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; locked=&#8221;off&#8221;]<p>The development of Indian security markets began with the launch of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in July 1875 and the Ahmedabad Stock exchange in 1894. Since then, 22 other exchanges have traded in Indian cities. In 2014, India&#8217;s stock exchange market became the 10th largest in the world by market capitalization, just above those of South Korea and Australia. India&#8217;s two major stock exchanges, BSE and the National Stock Exchange of India, had a market capitalization of US$1.71 trillion and US$1.68 trillion as of February 2015, according to the World Federation of Exchanges.<\/p>\n<p>The initial public offering (IPO) market in India has been small compared to NYSE and NASDAQ, raising US$300 million in 2013 and US$1.4 billion in 2012. Ernst &amp; Young stated that the low IPO activity reflects market conditions, slow government approval processes, and complex regulations. Before 2013, Indian companies were not allowed to list their securities internationally without first completing an IPO in India. In 2013, these security laws were reformed and Indian companies can now choose where they want to list first: overseas, domestically, or both concurrently. Further, security laws have been revised to ease overseas listings of already listed companies, to increase liquidity for private equity and international investors in Indian companies.<\/p>[\/et_pb_toggle][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243;
